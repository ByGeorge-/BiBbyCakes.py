# BiBbyCakes.py
A module to automatically output a formatted bibtex file. 

# What's the point? Can't I just copy and paste a ready made formatted bib from somewhere online like CiteULike?
Sure but what if you find a reference that is not easy to locate online in a bibtex format, but you have all the details? This allows you to input those details and have a nice bibtex file at the end of the day. 

# The future
Currently has no functionality for just inputting a txt file and outputting a bibtex.
